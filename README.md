# PlayOnlineQuieter
PlayOnlineViewer, used to launch Final Fantasy XI, has very loud audio files.
This simple mod to the PlayOnlineViewer software provides alternate, quieter
audio files so that your experience using PlayOnlineViewer is less annoying.

There are two versions of the modification
*	**Quieter Original:** This is all the original audio files modified to be
	-17dB in volume.
*	**Quieter Modified:** Mostly this is the same as *Quieter Original*, but
	with the two most common music files replaced (see "Credits" below). All
	the original audio files are still reduced by -17dB.

## Installation 
1.	On the Github page, click on the green "Code" button and download as a zip
2.	On your computer, unzip the file
3.	Choose the modification version you want to install
	1. **Quieter Original** - In the unzipped folder navigate to \quieter-original\polvformat
	2. **Quieter Modified** - In the unzipped folder navigate to \quieter-modified\polvformat
4.	Copy the mod's "viewer" folder into your PlayOnlineViewer folder (for
	example, in a steam installation the PlayOnlineViewer folder would be in
	c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FFXINA\SquareEnix\PlayOnlineViewer)
5.	After the copy ends you have successfully installed the mod.

## Uninstallation
The mod contains the original files as well if you ever want to go back to them.
Simply copy those files from the "original" folder inside the mod using the same
instructions as used for installing the mod.

## Credits
This work was made possible by the program XIMC, developed by a Japanese
developer whose name I do not know. That tool is included in this mod if you
would like to do some modification to the music files yourself. An English guide
on how to use XIMC can be found here: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/555735-final-fantasy-xi/faqs/30728

The "Quieter Modified" version of the mod makes the following two replacements
to the music used in PlayOnlineViewer
*	Instead of *Dolphin* by Noriko Matsueda, it plays *Final Fantasy X - Prelude*
	by Nobuo Uematsu.
*	Instead of *Space* by Noriko Matsueda it plays *Final Fantasy X-2 Eternity -
	Memory of Light Waves* by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi.
